# Web Data Management - Project 2
### What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
    Implementation of all parts were easy as this was an extention of the first project and all I had to do is modify the code to match the requirements.
    
### What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
    Making sure the UI is responsive in accordance with the ajax. To make sure the records are in order, had to handle the functionlaity properly.

### If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
    Considering how difficult it is to debug on any cloud, the configuration differences between a local setup and a cloud setup would be my biggest concern.
