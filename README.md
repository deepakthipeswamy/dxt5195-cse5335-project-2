# Web Data Management - Project 1
### What server framework did you choose and why?
    NodeJS. After over 20 years of stateless-web based on the stateless request-response paradigm, we finally have web applications with real-time, two-way connections, where both the client and server can initiate communication, allowing them to exchange data freely. This is in stark contrast to the typical web response paradigm, where the client always initiates communication. Additionally, itâ€™s all based on the open web stack (HTML, CSS and JS) running over the standard port 80.
    
### What client framework did you choose and why?
    Based on the manipulation of the HTML DOM (Document Object Model) and designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML, jQuery incorporates parts of HTML and CSS. It's light. Since jQuery pushes content to the client, it therefore reduces the wait time for server response. Plus, it's smaller than Flash, so it results in smoother playbacks and less errors. It works anywhere. HTML5 is cross-browser compatible-it will work on any browser, mobile phone or tablet, and even on Apple devices.

### What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
    The whole project was easy to implement because the functionality expected is very very easy. If there was a complicated functionality to be accomplished, it would have been more interesting and it would have given more scope for learning.
    
### What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
    None. I picked all the technologies I was not aware of and so it took me a few hours to read and understand them better but the implementation was not hard considering how many articles are available on the internet.
    
### What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install, if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?
    I have not installed any other components are modules other than the frameworks because there was no need for any. The frameworks are comprehensive enough to provide all necessary functionality.
    
### What Ubuntu commands are required to deploy and run your server?
    Heroku uses git for version control so, 
    $ git add 
    $ git commit
    $ git push heroku master
    
    The application is hosted on the heroku cloud.
    $ heroku pg:psql - For connecting to postgresql DB.
